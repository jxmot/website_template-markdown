# Website Template with Markdown Rendering and PDF Output

Welcome! I hope you find this template useful. I enjoyed creating it and I use it myself. 

## By Design...

This template was created so that I could fulfill a specific need that I had. I wanted a simple website that was capable of using *Markdown* text files for content. In addition, content changes or updates would **not** require any coding changes. Even if the content file names changed or if the files were relocated.

There are some additional features that I required:

* Be ***functional***. Just add content, make a few minor changes, and you've got a website.
* Configurable:
  * `<meta>` tags
  * Form debugging on/off
  * Miscellaneous text content
* Intended for dynamic content:
  * The browsers' URL bar is managed. Hash tag (`#`) links are not allowed to be seen. 
  * The "table of contents" and the content files are read *on demand* and rendered. 
  * Links back to the site(page) will always be to the landing.
* PDF Export: The ability to export selective content to PDF.
* A minimal and lightweight appearance.
* Small code footprint, < 200k not including third party libraries.
